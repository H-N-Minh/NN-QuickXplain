# DiagLearn

DiagLearn is a machine learning program able to learn and predict variable value orderings as inout for diagnosis algorithms such as FastDiag. The variable value orderings are predicted on basis a training dataset that includes historical diagnosis. The reordering of the variable values aims to decrease the runtime of the diagnosis algorithm significantly.
